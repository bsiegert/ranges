PACKAGE

package ranges
    import "."

    Package ranges contains tools for working with integer ranges.


    An "integer range" allows to give a set of numbers as a string, which
    can be parsed by a call to Parse. The result can be obtained as a slice
    of integers by calling Expand or be tested against with Contains.

FUNCTIONS

func Parse(r string) ([]int, error)


TYPES

type IntRange struct {
    Lo, Hi int
}
    An IntRange is a single component of an integer range expression.

func (ir IntRange) Contains(value int) bool
    Contains returns true if ir contains value.

func (ir IntRange) Expand() []int
    Expand returns a slice of integers that contains all the numbers in ir.

type IntRanges []IntRange
    IntRanges is a slice of multiple integer ranges, allowing the expression
    of non-contiguous ranges (for example "1,3-4").
